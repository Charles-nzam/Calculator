# Calculator

Hello guys,here's one of our latest projects on here which is a replica of an iphone calculator.It works just exactly as an iphone calculator would work and was created using html,css and of course javascript.it was really a fun project to do,lol and less i forget i was greatly assisted by a very good developer(my mentor)Mr Oxford Harrison.
I do hope to work on subsequent projects as well and host them on here.Thanks!
